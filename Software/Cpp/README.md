# GrovePi C++ library

This library provides the basic functions for using the GrovePi in C++.
See more about the GrovePi here:  https://www.nuget.org/packages/GrovePi/

### To install package:
First of all, you have to `cd` to `../GrovePi/Software/Cpp`
```
$ tar -xzvf grovepicpp_0.1.1.tar.gz
$ cd grovepicpplib_0.1.1
$ sudo dpkg --install ./grovepicpp_0.1.1.deb
```

The package contains the following sources:
* grovepi.cpp
* grove_dht_pro.cpp
* grove_rgb_lcd.cpp

### To uninstall package:
```
$ sudo dpkg --remove grovepicpp
```

### To compile with package installed:
```
g++ -Wall [dependencies[,..]].cpp -lgrovepicpp -o [program_name].out// the general format
```
```
g++ -Wall grove_relay.cpp -lgrovepicpp -o grove_relay.out // a trivial example
```

### To compile without package:
```
g++ -Wall grovepi.cpp [dependencies[,..]].cpp -o [program_name].out // the general format
```
```
g++ -Wall grovepi.cpp grove_relay.cpp -o grove_relay.out // a trivial example
```

### Then run the executable:
```
$ ./[program_name].out
```

# The basic library functionalities of GrovePi are:
* `initGrovePi()` : function for initializing communication w/ the GrovePi. It uses the implicit address of `0x04`
* `initDevice(uint8_t address)` : function for initializing communication with a device at a specific `address`
* `delay(milliseconds`) : function for delaying given milliseconds
* `pinMode(uint8_t pin, uint8_t mode)`: function for setting a digital/analog port accordingly. `mode` = `INPUT` / `OUTPUT`
* `digitalWrite(uint8_t pin, bool value)` : function for writing `HIGH`/`LOW` values to a digital port
* `digitalRead(uint8_t pin)` : function for returning the digital value (either `HIGH`/`LOW`) read on the given pin
* `analogWrite(uint8_t pin, uint8_t value)` : function for writing an analog value from 0-255 to a given pin
* `analogRead(uint8_t pin)` : function for reading the value on a given pin and which returns a value from 0-255
* `ultrasonicRead(uint8_t pin)` : function for returning the distance in centimeters an ultrasonic sensor reads on a given digital port pin
* `setMaxI2CRetries(int _max_i2c_retries)` : function for setting the maximum number of retries before quitting current operation - **you should not use it**
* `setGrovePiAddress(uint8_t addr)` : change the implicit GrovePi address -> this doesn't change the GrovePi's address (firmware-wise & physically), but it's only setting the address at which GrovePi is reachable - **you should not use it**
* `writeBlock(uint8_t command, uint8_t pin_number, uint8_t opt1 = 0, uint8_t opt2 = 0)` : function for issuing a command to the GrovePi. The command is targeting a certain pin. The optional arguments can be anything depending on the command. (for example for analogWriting, we would use opt1 for sending the value we want to write)
* `writeByte(uint8_t byte_val)` : it only sends a byte to the GrovePi. You can compose the `writeBlock` function by using multiple calls of this function
* `readBlock(uint8_t *data_block)` : returns via the pointer the read data from GrovePi. The length of the array is returned by the function
* `readByte()` : returns a byte from GrovePi

# Attention:
* it's currently not supported to use multiple I2C devices with this library, unless you reinitialize communication with the device you want to talk to (w/ `initgrovePi()` or `initDevice(uint8_t address)`
* for any of the given functions in this library, if an error occurs on the I2C line, a `GrovePi::I2CError()` is thrown. `GrovePi::I2CError()` is derived from `std::runtime_error`
* the library is included in `GrovePi` namespace, so don't forget to use the resolution operator or the `using` command.
